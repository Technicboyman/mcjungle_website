    <h2>MCJungle Rules and Punishments</h2> 
    <p>Of course like any other server, MCJungle has it's own rule set to ensure fair play and community positivity. Each subcategory will go over what the rule is and also the ban lengths for them. Note that the ban lengths are calculated based off your TOTAL bans, not per-category. So for example if you get banned for cheating and then for autogrinding the autogrinding ban will be considered a second offence ban!<br></p>

 <p><strong>How bans are issued on MCJungle:</strong> Video clips submitted by players, replays, and staff members watching your gameplay or chat activity. Note that staff may not show ban evidence to the offender due to privacy and security concerns.</p>

    <p><strong>What can you do to help?</strong> Upon seeing a cheater or any rule breaker, use the command /report on them for the reason 'cheating' or 'boosting' and a replay of their upcoming activity will be captured and viewed by a staff member later. Additionally, recording the offender breaking the rules can get them banned.<br><br></p>

    <h3>1. Cheating (Punishment Lengths: 1d/3d/7d/14d)</h3>
