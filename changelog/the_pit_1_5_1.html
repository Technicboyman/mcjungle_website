  <p>The Pit 1.5.1 - Anti Reset update:</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Anti Reset:</strong><br>
  Yup! That's right - MCJungle is being "anti-reset", meaning that everyone is getting their old items and stats back! (for the most part). However, there are a few caveats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anyone marked as a duper alt will not be eligible for the anti reset</li>
    <li>Anyone marked as a duper will have their mystics undergo a "downgrader" which weakens their most OP mystics and makes it more fair to others</li>
    <li>All old pure is being wiped</li>
    <li>A portion of your old XP is added on top of the new XP</li>
    <li>Some extra stats like ubers completed are added</li>
    <li>Normal bot boosters are replaced with mini bot boosters, since when the server reset players who bought normal size boosters were compensated</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Have fun and play like the old days!</p>
