      <p>
        Ever since The Pit reset, there has been some light content updates but they have not really changed the game that much. The new Pit 1.5 update completely changes that with its mass amount of content and exciting changes.

        <summary>New map and quest</summary>
        <p>Say hello to Map #3 - Fantasy! In this map, explore 4 beautiful areas - Cloud, Spooky, Mushroom, and Magic<br></br></p>

	<p><br></br>Fantasy map quest:</p>
	<p>The Fantasy Map also gets a new quest, and it is unique because it does not involve PVP, but instead mining. Mining??<br></br></p>

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Technicboyman/mcjungle_website/refs/heads/main/images/mining.png" alt="mines" width="500">

        <p><br></br>Carve your way through the underground with different types of pickaxes to uncover ores, caves, dungeons, and lava pools to work your way through the quest tiers and earn some sick rewards!<br></br></p>

	<p><br></br>Finally, explore new mechanics within the map such as launch pads in the outskirt areas to help you get away in a pinch!<br></br></p>

      <details class="expandable">
        <summary>More lobbies</summary>
        <p>There have been issues in the past with the singular lobby being too crammed and having it be difficult for new players to streak and participate in some events. Worry no more as there is now THREE seperate lobbies! Swap between them using /play pit <br></br>Additionally, minor events will still happen in these lobbies but for major events, even will be warped into a singular lobby for maximum fun!</p>
      </details>

      <details class="expandable">
        <summary>Reworked map system</summary>
        <p>There is no more map rotation. Now instead, as mentioned above, there are 3 lobbies, 1 lobby of each map. Now you simply pick the map you want to play! <br></br>This also results in the quest system being changed. You can now do all 3 map quests at the same time and reap all of the rewards. However, quest progress will be reset every 2 weeks for all players, so get all 3 of them done in 2 weeks for optimal rewards.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="expandable">
        <summary>Elimination Events</summary>
        <p>A new type of event has been added: Elimination Events! Here's how they work:<br></br></p>
        <p>When they start, players have one minute to decide if they want to join. Players who choose to join will be warped into the elimination lobby which can be of any map. Don't worry, your streak, bounty, and megastreak is preserved and will be restored when you leave the event. When the event starts, it's game on. The last person surviving reaps all of the rewards and those who die can spectate the event. There are currently 2 elimination events:<br></br></p>
        <p>Hot Potato: Similar to TNT Tag on hypixel - Attack players to pass the hot potato and whoever has it when the timer expires gets eliminated!</p>
	<p>Disasters: Be the last one standing in a world with terrorizing disasters like rising lava, dragons, creeper infestation, shrinking world border, and lightning!<br></br></p>
